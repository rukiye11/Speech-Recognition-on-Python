# Speech-Recognition-on-Python
Hi guys. I'd like to share my Speech Recognition code with you. I used the RealPython site when writing this code and using audio files. If you wish, you can look for more information. First you need to install the Speech Recognition library. You must also use an API to convert an audio file to text. I used it because the Google Speech Recognition API is already in the Speech Recognition library. If you want to study with the microphone later, you must install the PyAudio package. I got one error about the code I shared. When I run recognize_google, I get FileNotFoundError. I don't know why I bought it, but it got better after updating my computer. If you get an error like this, you can try updating your computer. Other than that, if you are using Anaconda like me, you should be careful when installing the PyAudio package. Because you need to install with conda, not with pip. I hope the sharing has been beneficial for you. Good coding.
